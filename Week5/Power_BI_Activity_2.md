# Power BI Activity (Analyze)

## Goal

Practice using Power BI as well as gathering insights from the Analyze
tool.

## Description

Import the "Contoso Sales for Power BI Designer" Dataset (you can find a
project with the data imported on the GitHub, week 4). Load this data
into Power BI. By creating visualizations and using the "Analyze" tool,
answer the following questions:

1)  Why might "Computers" be the highest revenue producing category?

2)  Why might Fabrikam have the highest revenue?

3)  Why might the "Noth American Back-to-School" promotion contain the
    most sales by number and revenue out of any other promotion?

4)  Why might there have been a big sales decrease starting January 1,
    2012?
