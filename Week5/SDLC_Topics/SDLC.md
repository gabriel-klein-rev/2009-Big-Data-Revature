The Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) is the application of standard business practices to building software applications. It’s typically divided into six to eight steps: Planning, Requirements, Design, Build, Document, Test, Deploy, Maintain. Some project managers will combine, split, or omit steps, depending on the project’s scope. These are the core components recommended for all software development projects.

SDLC is a way to measure and improve the development process. It allows a fine-grain analysis of each step of the process. This, in turn, helps companies maximize efficiency at each stage. As computing power increases, it places a higher demand on software and developers. Companies must reduce costs, deliver software faster, and meet or exceed their customers’ needs. SDLC helps achieve these goals by identifying inefficiencies and higher costs and fixing them to run smoothly.

Organizations can use the SDLC process to provide structure when designing and building of applications.

This life cycle provides an effective plan for various activities in software development such as designing, building (developing), and maintaining software applications. It also provides a methodology for enhancing the quality of software applications in an organization. Organizations can choose an effective software development strategy from a variety of SDLC process models.

Various people in the organization can use the SDLC such as software engineers, developers, and cross-function teams. Developers and software engineers use it to create effective plans and designs. They also apply the various SDLC stages to develop innovative software products. Cross-function teams use the SDLC to collaborate across different software development stages.

### Importance of SDLC

The software development life cycle adds value to software development in the following ways:
- It provides an effective framework and method to develop software applications.
- It helps in effectively planning before starting the actual development. SDLC allows developers to analyze the requirements.
- It helps in reducing unnecessary costs during development. During the initial phases, developers can estimate the costs and predict costly mistakes.
- It enables developers to design and build high-quality software products. This is because they follow a systematic process that allows them to test the software before it is rolled out.
- It provides a basis when evaluating the effectiveness of the software. This further enhances the software product.

The following are general stages of the Software Development Life Cycle. Depending on the scope of the project, some stages may be omitted, and other stages may be enhanced.

### Planning

In the Planning phase, project leaders evaluate the terms of the project. This includes calculating labor and material costs, creating a timetable with target goals, and creating the project’s teams and leadership structure.

Planning can also include feedback from stakeholders. Stakeholders are anyone who stands to benefit from the application. Try to get feedback from potential customers, developers, subject matter experts, and sales reps.

Planning should clearly define the scope and purpose of the application. It plots the course and provisions the team to effectively create the software. It also sets boundaries to help keep the project from expanding or shifting from its original purpose.

### Define Requirements

Defining requirements is considered part of planning to determine what the application is supposed to do and its requirements. For example, a social media application would require the ability to connect with a friend. An inventory program might require a search feature.

Requirements also include defining the resources needed to build the project. For example, a team might develop software to control a custom manufacturing machine. The machine is a requirement in the process.

### Design and Prototyping

The Design phase models the way a software application will work. Some aspects of the design include:
- Architecture – Specifies programming language, industry practices, overall design, and use of any templates or boilerplate
- User Interface – Defines the ways customers interact with the software, and how the software responds to input
- Platforms – Defines the platforms on which the software will run, such as Apple, Android, Windows version, Linux, or even gaming consoles
- Programming – Not just the programming language, but including methods of solving problems and performing tasks in the application
- Communications – Defines the methods that the application can communicate with other assets, such as a central server or other instances of the application
- Security – Defines the measures taken to secure the application, and may include SSL traffic encryption, password protection, and secure storage of user credentials

Prototyping can be a part of the Design phase. A prototype is like one of the early versions of software in the Iterative software development model. It demonstrates a basic idea of how the application looks and works. This “hands-on” design can be shown to stakeholders, and feedback can be used to improve the application. It’s less expensive to change the Prototype phase than to rewrite code to make a change in the Development phase.

### Software Development

This is the actual writing of the program. A small project might be written by a single developer, while a large project might be broken up and worked on by several teams. Use an Access Control or Source Code Management application in this phase. These systems help developers track changes to the code. They also help ensure compatibility between different team projects and to make sure target goals are being met.

The coding process includes many other tasks. Many developers need to brush up on skills or work as a team. Finding and fixing errors and glitches is critical. Tasks often hold up the development process, such as waiting for test results or compiling code so an application can run. SDLC can anticipate these delays so that developers can be tasked with other duties.

Software developers appreciate instructions and explanations. Documentation can be a formal process, including writing a user guide for the application. It can also be informal, like comments in the source code that explain why a developer used a certain procedure. Even companies that strive to create software that’s easy and intuitive benefit from the documentation.

Documentation can be a quick guided tour of the application’s basic features that display on the first launch. It can be video tutorials for complex tasks. Written documentation like user guides, troubleshooting guides, and FAQ’s help users solve problems or technical questions.

### Testing

It’s critical to test an application before making it available to users. Much of the testing can be automated, like security testing. Other testing can only be done in a specific environment – consider creating a simulated production environment for complex deployments. Testing should ensure that each function works correctly. Different parts of the application should also be tested to work seamlessly together—performance test, to reduce any hangs or lags in processing. The testing phase helps reduce the number of bugs and glitches that users encounter. This leads to a higher user satisfaction and a better usage rate.

### Deployment

In the deployment phase, the application is made available to users. Many companies prefer to automate the deployment phase. This can be as simple as displaying a payment portal and download link on the company website. It could also be downloading an application on a smartphone.

Deployment can also be complex. Upgrading a company-wide database to a newly-developed application is one example. Because there are several other systems used by the database, integrating the upgrade can take more time and effort.

### Operations and Maintenance

At this point, the development cycle is almost finished. The application is done and being used in the field. The Operation and Maintenance phase is still important, though. In this phase, users discover bugs that weren’t found during testing. These errors need to be resolved, which can spawn new development cycles.

In addition to bug fixes, models like Iterative development plan additional features in future releases. For each new release, a new Development Cycle can be launched.
