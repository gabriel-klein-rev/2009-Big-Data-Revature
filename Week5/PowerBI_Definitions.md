# Power BI Definitions

### Report View
    - This is the primary canvas for creating visualizations. You can drag and drop fields to create charts, tables, and other visual elements.

### Table View/Data View
    - This view shows your data in a tabular format, similar to Excel. You can inspect and manipulate data here.

### Model View
    - The Model view displays the relationships between tables in your dataset. You can create, edit, and manage relationships here.

### Fields Pane
    -  Located on the right side, this pane displays the tables and fields in your data model. You can drag these fields onto the report canvas to create visualizations.

### Visualizations Pane
    - Also on the right, this pane provides a variety of visualization options (charts, graphs, maps, etc.) that you can use to represent your data.

### Power Query
    - The data connection technology used in Power BI for data discovery, connectivity, and transformations. It is the engine behind the Query Editor.

### Tile
    - Single visualization found on a dashboard/report. Tiles are essentially snapshots of your data, capturing the state of a visualization at a specific point in time. They can represent various types of visualizations, such as charts, graphs, maps, images, web content, and more.

### Reports
    - Multi-page documents that contain various visualizations, data tables, and interactive elements. Reports are designed to provide detailed insights and analysis of data, allowing users to explore and understand the information more deeply.

### Dashboard

Dashboards are designed to help users monitor and analyze data at a glance, allowing them to make informed decisions quickly. Only available on Power BI Service.
